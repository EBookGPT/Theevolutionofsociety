## Exercise 1

**Question:** Explain the concept of globalization and its impact on national economies.

**Answer:** Globalization refers to the integration of national economies into the global economy through the exchange of goods, services, capital, and technology. It has been facilitated by the liberalization of trade policies, the growth of multinational corporations, and advancements in communication and transportation technologies. The impact of globalization on national economies includes increased competition, access to new markets, greater efficiency, and job creation. However, it also leads to the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few, exploitation of workers and resources, and vulnerability to economic crises.

**Question:** What is modernization and how did it transform traditional societies?

**Answer:** Modernization refers to the adoption of modern technologies, institutions, and values, which transformed traditional agrarian-based societies into industrial and service-oriented ones. It led to a shift from subsistence farming and feudal relations to wage-labor, urbanization, and secularization. Modernization brought about significant improvements in infrastructure, education, health care, and life expectancy. However, it also contributed to the erosion of traditional cultures, the loss of social cohesion, and environmental degradation.
