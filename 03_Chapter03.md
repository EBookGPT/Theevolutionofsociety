# Chapter 3: River Valley Civilizations and the Rise of Empires

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we explored the emergence of human society during the prehistoric period. We learned about the evolution of human beings and the formation of early societies. In this chapter, we will take a step forward and delve into the rise of River Valley Civilizations and Empires.

As societies continued to grow, people began to settle down in river valleys such as those of the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, and the Indus. The availability of water and fertile land led to the development of agriculture, an increase in the population and trade. This growth led to the establishment of the first organized societies in history.

In addition to the growth of organized societies, this period saw the rise of great empires, such as the Babylonian Empire under the rule of Hammurabi. As a special guest in this chapter, we will learn about his leadership and contribution to the development of society.

As you read through this chapter, you will come to understand the significance of these civilizations and empires in our current day. So, let's get started on this journey of discovery!

```python
#Sample code for understanding the river valley civilizations

#defining the dictionary of river valley civilizations
river_valley_civilizations = {'Nile': 'Ancient Egypt', 'Indus': 'Indus Valley Civilization', 'Tigris and Euphrates': 'Mesopotamian Civilization'}

def print_civilizations():
    print("The major river valley civilizations were:")
    for river, civilization in river_valley_civilizations.items():
        print("- " + civilization + " in the " + river + " river valley.")

print_civilizations()
```

Output:
```
The major river valley civilizations were:
- Ancient Egypt in the Nile river valley.
- Indus Valley Civilization in the Indus river valley.
- Mesopotamian Civilization in the Tigris and Euphrates river valley.

# Chapter 3: River Valley Civilizations and the Rise of Empires

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we explored the emergence of human society during the prehistoric period. We learned about the evolution of human beings and the formation of early societies. In this chapter, we will take a step forward and delve into the rise of River Valley Civilizations and Empires.

## The Rise of River Valley Civilizations
As societies continued to grow, people began to settle down in river valleys such as those of the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates, and the Indus. The availability of water and fertile land led to the development of agriculture, an increase in the population and trade. This growth led to the establishment of the first organized societies in history.

These river valley civilizations included Ancient Egypt in the Nile river valley, Indus Valley Civilization in the Indus river valley, and Mesopotamian Civilization in the Tigris and Euphrates river valley. Each civilization had its unique characteristics that contributed to the further development of society.

## The Rise of Empires
In addition to the growth of organized societies, this period saw the rise of great empires, such as the Babylonian Empire under the rule of Hammurabi. Hammurabi was the sixth king of the Babylonian Empire and is well-known for his code of laws, known as the Code of Hammurabi. The code emphasized the principle of "an eye for an eye" and was significant in the development of the legal system and governance. As a special guest in this chapter, Hammurabi will share more about his leadership and contribution to the development of society.

The rise of empires in this period marked a shift in politics and governance. The empires were ruled by powerful monarchs and had centralized governments that controlled a vast territory, encompassing several cities and regions. This period lays a foundation for modern governance and administration.

As you read through this chapter, you will understand the significance of these civilizations and empires in our current day. The principles of governance and administration laid the foundation for modern society. So, let's explore this chapter with the help of our special guest, Hammurabi!

```python
#Sample code for understanding the Code of Hammurabi

#defining dictionary of laws
code_of_laws = {
    1: 'If a man brings an accusation against another man, charging him with murder, but cannot prove it, the accuser shall be put to death.',
    2: 'If a man bears false witness in a case, or does not establish the testimony that he has given, if that case is one involving life, that man shall be put to death.',
    3: 'If a judge pronounces judgment, renders a decision, delivers a verdict duly signed and sealed, and afterward alters his judgment, they shall call that judge to account for the alteration that he has made in his judgment, which he pronounced, and he shall pay twelve-fold the penalty in that judgment pronounced by him, and in the assembly they shall expel him from his judgment seat.',
    4: 'If a man bears false witness concerning grain or money, he himself shall bear the penalty imposed in the judgment which he wished to give against the other.',
}

def print_laws():
    print("Code of Hammurabi Laws:")
    for law_num, law_text in code_of_laws.items():
        print(str(law_num) + ". " + law_text)

print_laws()
```

Output:
```
Code of Hammurabi Laws:
1. If a man brings an accusation against another man, charging him with murder, but cannot prove it, the accuser shall be put to death.
2. If a man bears false witness in a case, or does not establish the testimony that he has given, if that case is one involving life, that man shall be put to death.
3. If a judge pronounces judgment, renders a decision, delivers a verdict duly signed and sealed, and afterward alters his judgment, they shall call that judge to account for the alteration that he has made in his judgment, which he pronounced, and he shall pay twelve-fold the penalty in that judgment pronounced by him, and in the assembly they shall expel him from his judgment seat.
4. If a man bears false witness concerning grain or money, he himself shall bear the penalty imposed in the judgment which he wished to give against the other.
```
The code used in the sample solves the task of understanding a few of the Code of Hammurabi laws. The code is written in Python and comprises the following parts:

- The code defines a `code_of_laws` dictionary, which has the law number as the key and the law text as the value.
- Then it defines a function `print_laws()` that simply prints the law numbers and their corresponding text in the console using a for loop.
- Finally, the function is called using `print_laws()`, which leads to the output of the law numbers and texts present in the code_of_laws dictionary.

This code can be useful for someone trying to read and understand the Code of Hammurabi laws. By modifying the dictionary with the desired law numbers and texts, anyone can use this code to print the laws in the console.
